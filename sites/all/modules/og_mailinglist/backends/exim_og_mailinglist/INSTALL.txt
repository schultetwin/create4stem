These files are for integrating OG Mailinglist with the EXIM MTA.

# Installation Instructions
Only tested on Debian/Ubuntu systems, documentation for others is welcome.


1) Copy this entire folder to /etc/exim4/

cp -r ../exim_og_mailinglist /etc/exim4/


2) Link 950_exim4-config_drupal_og_mailinglist_router
to /etc/exim4/conf.d/router/950_exim4-config_drupal_og_mailinglist_router

ln -s \
/etc/exim4/exim_og_mailinglist/950_exim4-config_drupal_og_mailinglist_router \
/etc/exim4/conf.d/router/950_exim4-config_drupal_og_mailinglist_router


3) Link 95_exim4-config_drupal_og_mailinglist_transport
to /etc/exim4/conf.d/transport/95_exim4-config_drupal_og_mailinglist_transport

ln -s \
/etc/exim4/exim_og_mailinglist/95_exim4-config_drupal_og_mailinglist_transport \
/etc/exim4/conf.d/transport/95_exim4-config_drupal_og_mailinglist_transport


4) Copy example.site_info.php to site_info.php

cp /etc/exim4/exim_og_mailinglist/example.site_info.php \
/etc/exim4/exim_og_mailinglist/site_info.php


5) Adjust settings in that file.

nano /etc/exim4/exim_og_mailinglist/site_info.php


6) Run dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config on Debain/Ubuntu systems and ensure that
the "Other destinations for which mail is accepted:" or "local domains" setting
includes your site's domain name.
Otherwise, Exim will simply reject emails directed to this domain.
Also allow exim4 to recieve mail from wilderness, set
"IP-addresses to listen on for incoming SMTP connections"
to be blank, otherwise only listed hosts can send you email.


7) Restart exim by running
/etc/init.d/exim4 restart

Note that on some operating systems like Debian, you need to run
"update-exim4.conf.template" to actually update the configuration before
restarting. See your installation's Exim documentation for specifics.


8) Test setup by sending email to a test group's email on your site,
e.g. test-group@example.com


Debugging help for when things don't work:
SSH into your server, run "tail -f /var/log/exim/mainlog" to see that
emails are actually reaching your server and that the og_mailinglist
router/transports are being called.
Also, it might help to look at the Drupal logs at admin/reports/dblog
